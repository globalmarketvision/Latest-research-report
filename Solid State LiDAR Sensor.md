Solid State LiDAR Sensor Market 2022 Business Growth And Prominent Players: Velodyne, Quanergy, LeddarTech, ABAX Sensing

The [solid-state LiDAR](https://globalmarketvision.com/reports/global-solid-state-lidar-sensor-market-report-2019-market/95710) is a sensor based on a silicon chip that doesn’t involve mechanically moving parts. The solid-state LiDAR sensors are compact and not only it is more robust but also save construction space within the scanners which allows them to reach extremely small dimensions and cut costs. Owing to its smaller size it can be variably integrated into vehicles, infrastructure, and building structures. The solid-state LiDAR sensors are a perfect fit for the automotive sector as it saves space, are almost inconspicuous and at the same time, it is aesthetic and provides a robust solution. Owing to these factors we can conclude that solid-state LiDAR offers more advantages than electromechanical systems.

LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a technique that uses pulses of light to perform distance measurements. Most LIDAR systems are based on measuring the time it takes for a laser pulse to complete a round trip between the LIDAR device and the target. After the distance to the target is calculated, the laser beam is scanned in different directions to create a 3D point cloud that provides spatial location and depth information, which can be used to identify and track objects.
